# UAV Photogrammetry Digital Twin Creation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for creating digital twins from UAV photogrammetry data. These scripts are derived from the examples provided in the [Agisoft Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) Scripts repository, which is licensed under the MIT License.

## Overview

The scripts provided here are tailored specifically for the creation of digital twins using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) photogrammetry techniques. They offer functionalities for processing aerial imagery, generating 3D models, and creating digital representations of real-world environments.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you will need to have Agisoft Metashape installed on your system. Follow the instructions provided by Agisoft for installation and setup.

Once installed, simply clone this repository and run the scripts using Python. Each script may require specific parameters to be set, so make sure to refer to the documentation provided with each script for detailed usage instructions.
